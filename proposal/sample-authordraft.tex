\section{Introduction}
% In the USA context, students in computer science (CS) often represent a homogeneous group, primarily comprising white cishet men with relative privilege. This homogeneity is perpetuated by early educational practices, such as 'tracking,' which can prematurely include or exclude students from certain electives, resources, and opportunities, including CS education. There is a growing recognition that a more diverse range of students should have the opportunity to learn CS and be introduced to it in an appropriate manner. It is plausible that if more people from underrepresented groups were invited to CS education in culturally appropriate and relevant and metacognitively accessible ways, they might develop a sustained interest in the field. Interestingly, students enrolled in instrumental music education (IME) courses exhibit a demographic correlation closer to their schools' overall demographic profile compared to those in CS. Therefore, exploring avenues that can attract students from music education backgrounds to CS, while complementing their IME curriculum, holds promise. We propose integrating activities that teach computational thinking, programming, and early CS concepts within the context of instrumental music education activities as a means to achieve this goal.

In the USA context, students in computer science (CS) often represent a homogeneous group, primarily comprising white, cishet men with relative privilege. This homogeneity is perpetuated by early educational practices, such as 'tracking,' which can prematurely include or exclude students from certain electives, resources, and opportunities, including CS education. There is a growing recognition that a more diverse range of students should have the opportunity to learn CS and be introduced to it in culturally appropriate and metacognitively accessible ways. If more students from underrepresented groups were invited to CS education through relevant and engaging methods, they might develop a sustained interest in the field.
Interestingly, students enrolled in instrumental music education (IME) courses exhibit a demographic correlation closer to their schools' overall demographic profile compared to those in CS. This raises the possibility of leveraging music education as a platform for introducing CS concepts to a broader audience. Music composition shares cognitive and logical processes with computational thinkingâ€”both involve patterns, structures, and problem-solving. Students learning music already navigate abstract symbolic languages (e.g., musical notation), which could facilitate their transition into understanding coding languages. By integrating CS concepts into familiar IME activities, we can lower the intimidation factor that often accompanies programming and help students view CS as an extension of their existing creative processes.
Furthermore, the synergy between music and coding provides an avenue for students to explore creative expression through both disciplines. Music students are accustomed to revising their compositions based on feedback, much like programmers debug their code. This overlap of iterative thinking provides a natural entry point into programming, making the transition feel less foreign and more relevant to their experiences. Importantly, this integration also offers immediate, engaging feedbackâ€”students can see and hear the effects of coding changes in real-time, reinforcing their understanding of computational concepts in a tangible and enjoyable way.
In addition to fostering creativity, integrating CS into music education serves a broader educational equity goal. By introducing computational thinking in a setting that is already more inclusive and representative, we can provide access to CS education for students who might otherwise miss out due to tracking or limited resources. Music education, with its historically diverse participation, becomes a vehicle for democratizing access to early CS education and addressing the demographic imbalances currently seen in the field.
We propose integrating activities that teach computational thinking, programming, and early CS concepts within the context of instrumental music education activities as a means to achieve these goals. By combining the creative and cognitive strengths of music education with computational thinking, this approach has the potential to attract a more diverse range of students to the field of computer science.

\subsection{Computational Thinking in Education}
In the 1980s,~\citet{papert1980mindstorms} wished for a future where ``to think like a computer" would be considered an ordinary component of thinking skills (p. 155). In line with this,~\citet{wing2006computationalthinking} argues that Computational Thinking (CT) is not just a programming skill, but a daily life skill. According to~\citet{otero2020computational}, CT ``is closely associated with the efforts to convey a systematic and well-structured way of solving problems" (p. 130).~\citet{tatar2017protoCT} describe CT as the principle of ``using elements easily recognizable to computer scientists as computer science, that is, creating algorithms and meta-level descriptions of code, coding, engaging in explicit acts of structure creation, structured top-down problem solving, and so forth" (p. 65). While CT may be defined as elements that are, ``recognizable to computer scientists as computer science'' it is clear that CT includes concepts and  skills that are useful to a wide range of disciplines and problems. CT may be a skill that employs, i.e., abstraction, decomposition, generalisation and evaluation~\cite{selby2013computational}, with the goal to identify patterns, lay connections and ultimately problem-solve. 
% use the concept of proto-computational thinking but maybe use another type of definition like critical thinking (critical thinking is probably part of computational thinking) -> Michael does not necessarily value the name 'proto-computational thinking'
% argument: people (from maybe low-SES) are scared off by CS because they think it is 'difficult', 'only for nerds', 'only for the smartest people'

% what kind of different types of representations are there? In music we have all kinds of note schemes, even depending on what instrument you play it may be different

% Question to answer: why would representing the music in different kinds of structures\representations suddenly make students convinced that they can do CS as well?
% - explain the thought process (maybe some psychology behind it)
% - explain the steps that are taken by the student 

% currently the higher-level argument in the grant is kind of missing. 


Although the term CT is relatively new, the practice of teaching CT has been around in education for many years, albeit under different terms~\cite{czerkawski2015exploring}, i.e., procedural thinking~\cite{papert1980mindstorms}, operational thinking, .... One of the earliest known examples of introducing CT to education is during an introductory programming course by Alan Perlis in 1962 at Carnegie Mellon University--then Carnegie Institute of Technology~\cite{perlis1962computer}. In various education systems, CT is being introduced in school curricula simply under labels such as `Computing', `Digital Technologies', and `Computer Science'~\cite{duncan2015pilot, heintz2016reviewofmodels, hubwieser2015global}. However, the introduction of CT in school curricula raises several concerns \cite{tatar2017protoCT}. For our purposes the most relevant is the fact that school curricula tend to be full, and introducing another subject poses the risk of impairing the notion of offering students a `rounded education'~\cite{bell2018integrating}.

\subsection{Integrated Computational Thinking}
1. there's success integrating it in other courses/disciplines

2. we note that many other disciplines have more proportionate representation of all demographics than computer science (why it's reasonable to care about integrating in other areas/fields) 


While computer science has made strides in terms of balancing demographics representation among more groups, the discipline continues to struggle with issues of diversity, particularly with respect to gender and race. Despite Computer Science having started as a women-dominated field.\todo[inline]{CITATION REQUIRED}
In contrast, fields such as music and the social sciences have significantly more proportionate representation across different demographic groups. For instance, women represent over half (62\%) of visual and performing arts degree holders and 21\% of computer science degree holders. Similar patterns are observed in terms of racial diversity, with Black and Hispanic students underrepresented in computer science compared to the broader representation in fields like sociology. This disparity suggests that integrating computer science education into more diverse disciplines --- such as music --- has the potential to broaden access to early expereiences with computer science such as computational thinking which could foster greater inclusivity in the field.

\section{Purpose}

The purpose of this project is to introduce computational thinking to instrumental education students (like those in middle school band and orchestra classes). Our approach will be to integrate new activities into MusicCPR. MusicCPR is a niche Learning Management System for band and orchestra classes. MusicCPR is implemented as a web application and continues an iterative design and development process as part of its participatory design process including current in-service and pre-service instrumental music educators and music education researchers as co-designers.

MusicCPR currently has ``Creativity'' activities that task the student with composing a musical score (see figure) \todo{make this figure}. As part of this project, we will design and develop new versions of the existing Creativity activities. In the new versions, we will add a block-based programming interface. Deciding which block language to use, and exactly what the user experience with the blocks should be is part of this project's effort. In the interest of illustrating the design space, we now provide a possible implementation.

\section{Research Methods}


\subsection{Participants}
The participants in this study will be Music Education teachers and students currently enrolled in MusicCPR test groups. This group has been selected due to their familiarity with the MusicCPR platform, as well as previous success in obtaining informed consent from teachers, parents, and students for related studies. These factors make them ideal candidates for testing the integration of computational thinking into music education. Efforts will be made to ensure a diverse participant pool in terms of age, musical experience, and technological proficiency, to fully assess the toolâ€™s usability across different demographics.

\subsection{Pilot Study Design}
The pilot study will be conducted in two phases. The first phase will focus on usability testing, during which participants will be introduced to the block-based programming interface within MusicCPR. They will complete guided activities designed to evaluate the intuitiveness of the interface and identify any usability issues. In the second phase, participants will engage more independently with the tool, allowing for the assessment of engagement levels and the measurement of learning outcomes. Pre- and post-assessments will be administered to determine any gains in participantsâ€™ understanding of computational thinking and music theory.

\subsection{Data Collection and Analysis}
Both qualitative and quantitative data will be collected during the study. Qualitative feedback will be gathered primarily through surveys, providing insights into user experience, engagement, and perceived learning benefits. Interviews with teachers and students will also be considered. Quantitative data will include pre- and post-assessment scores, time spent on tasks, and error rates, all of which will be analyzed to evaluate both usability and learning outcomes. The qualitative data will be coded and analyzed to identify common themes related to usability and engagement. Quantitative data will be statistically analyzed to determine the effectiveness of the tool in enhancing participantsâ€™ computational thinking and music composition skills.

\subsection{Timeline}
The development of the block-based programming interface will take place during Fall 2024, with iterative input from music educators and students. The pilot study will be conducted in Spring 2025, with concurrent data collection and analysis. The findings will inform further refinement of the tool.

\subsection{Ethical Considerations}
Informed consent will be obtained from all participants, ensuring they are aware of the studyâ€™s purpose and their rights, including the option to withdraw at any time. All participant data will be anonymized and securely stored to maintain confidentiality.


\section{Possible Implementation}
% 
\subsection{Existing Research and Tools}  
Research on block-based languages in computer science education, particularly Googleâ€™s Blockly, has shown their effectiveness in teaching programming concepts. Blockly, which powers widely-used platforms such as Scratch and Code.org, is noted for its user-friendly design, making it an ideal candidate for this project. Its accessibility for both developers and learners suggests it is the most appropriate tool for implementing a block-based programming language that aligns with the goals of this project.

\subsection{Transition Plan for Introducing Coding Blocks}
The introduction of coding blocks will be phased in over three stages, ensuring students gradually become familiar with the new technology while maintaining their existing musical activities. 

Stage 1: Familiarity through Existing Frameworks  
Initially, students will continue their usual workflow, completing Music CPR and "create" activities for one musical piece. This will establish a baseline of familiarity with the musical content and process.

Stage 2: Gradual Integration of Coding Concepts 
In the second stage, students will revisit the activities with an additional layer: code blocks corresponding to their current score will be displayed on the screen. These blocks will visualize the underlying structure of the music in a computational context. At this stage, guided questions will be introduced to spark curiosity and prompt reflection on the relationship between the music and code.

Stage 3: Active Manipulation and Exploration
By the third stage, students will engage more actively by manipulating the code blocks themselves. During their third piece, they will experiment with altering the blocks to observe how those changes affect the music they are creating. This hands-on interaction is designed to solidify their understanding of the link between code and music.

\subsection{Transition to Full Creative Freedom}
Once students are comfortable with the technology, they will be able to compose freely, either using traditional music composition tools (such as FlatIO) or the newly introduced block-based programming environment. This final step empowers students to choose their preferred method of creation, ensuring flexibility and fostering creativity.


% \textbf{Implementation Questions:}
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item What language should code blocks be translated to? (Python, Previously existing teaching language, Pseudo Code?)
%     \item How many steps should there be in the gradual introduction of- and expectation to use/interact with- programming blocks? e.g. 3-step plan students will be assigned 3 pieces of repertoire in sequence in musiccpr: 
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item student completes all activities as they are right now in musiccpr for 1 piece of repertoire.
%         \item when doing compose for the 2nd piece they will see blocks appear corresponding to the authoring they're doing, perhaps be asked some guided inquiry questions about the blocks
%         \item when doing 3rd piece's compose activity, they might be asked to manipulate the blocks
%     \end{itemize}
%     \item How should the users compose their score? (FlatIO?, etc.)
%     \item Does each portion of the project (Code blocks, music score creation, translation) need to be implemented in separate steps, or should work be done on all parts in tandem?
%     \item How much Fall time should be spent on research before implementation should begin?
% \end{itemize}



% Research and develop software to introduce more students to computational thinking.
 % MusicCPR could be a good platform to expose students to programming and computer science-related ideas.

The primary objective of this thesis project is to complement the existing work on MusicCPR with new features that introduce computational thinking in a more familiar context than as a standalone course.
In the United States, many more students have access to instrumental music education than to computer science or computational thinking education.
The students who have access to computer science and computational thinking education opportunities tend to belong to demographics that experience disproportionate unearned privilege in comparison to a school's overall demographic profile.
By developing activities in MusicCPR that introduce computational thinking, we have the opportunity to increase access to computational thinking education.
This might support the students in their primary task (composing music for their instrumental music course) in addition to providing opportunities for students who may not have otherwise had access to experience computational thinking education.
This could broaden participation in computing education by groups that are currently underrepresented.
To study the potential for increasing access and opportunity to various students, we must collect student demographic and experience data:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item race
    \item class
    \item gender
    \item past/current experience with computing education
\end{enumerate}

% Have you ver done programming activity in or out of school?
% computer science class in the school (informal vs formal education)
% camp, etc.
% level of interest

With the project's main objective being the introduction of computational thinking to more students with an additional goal of increasing participation in courses by a group of students who more accurately represent the demographics of the school. Relevant demographic information of participating students such as gender, race, and socio-economic background should be collected in order to assess the success of this part of the objective. This data should also be used to compare against the overall demographics of the school. 

A number of quantitative assessments can be administered for additional analysis like pre and post program assessments to measure knowledge of computer concepts, additional tests for music compositional aptitude, as well as classroom analytics like participation, attendance, and retention. Qualitative surveys and questionnaires could be used to gauge both student and teacher feedback in addition to recording potential interest or disinterest in computer science and music composition further into the future of their academic career. 

The comparison to already existing `Creativity' activities within MusicCPR would provide a benchmark for assessing how these new features impact student engagement and learning outcomes. By evaluating both sets of activities under similar conditions, we can determine whether the proposed innovations offer significant improvements in terms of user interaction, creative output, and overall effectiveness within the program. While comparing these new ideas to the existing `Creativity' activities within MusicCPR would provide valuable insights into their relative impact on student engagement and learning outcomes, such an analysis may extend beyond the scope of this project due to time constraints. However, this could be an area for future research, allowing for a more comprehensive evaluation of the program's overall effectiveness.
