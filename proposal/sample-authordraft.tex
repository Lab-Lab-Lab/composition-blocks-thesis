\section{Introduction}
In the USA context, students in computer science (CS) often represent a homogeneous group, primarily comprising white cishet men with relative privilege. This homogeneity is perpetuated by early educational practices, such as 'tracking,' which can prematurely include or exclude students from certain electives, resources, and opportunities, including CS education. There is a growing recognition that a more diverse range of students should have the opportunity to learn CS and be introduced to it in an appropriate manner. It is plausible that if more people from underrepresented groups were invited to CS education in culturally appropriate and relevant and metacognitively accessible ways, they might develop a sustained interest in the field. Interestingly, students enrolled in instrumental music education (IME) courses exhibit a demographic correlation closer to their schools' overall demographic profile compared to those in CS. Therefore, exploring avenues that can attract students from music education backgrounds to CS, while complementing their IME curriculum, holds promise. We propose integrating activities that teach computational thinking, programming, and early CS concepts within the context of instrumental music education activities as a means to achieve this goal.

\subsection{Computational Thinking in Education}
In the 1980s,~\citet{papert1980mindstorms} wished for a future where ``to think like a computer" would be considered an ordinary component of thinking skills (p. 155). In line with this,~\citet{wing2006computationalthinking} argues that Computational Thinking (CT) is not just a programming skill, but a daily life skill. According to~\citet{otero2020computational}, CT ``is closely associated with the efforts to convey a systematic and well-structured way of solving problems" (p. 130).~\citet{tatar2017protoCT} describe CT as the principle of ``using elements easily recognizable to computer scientists as computer science, that is, creating algorithms and meta-level descriptions of code, coding, engaging in explicit acts of structure creation, structured top-down problem solving, and so forth" (p. 65). While CT may be defined as elements that are, ``recognizable to computer scientists as computer science'' it is clear that CT includes concepts and  skills that are useful to a wide range of disciplines and problems. CT may be a skill that employs, i.e., abstraction, decomposition, generalisation and evaluation~\cite{selby2013computational}, with the goal to identify patterns, lay connections and ultimately problem-solve. 
% use the concept of proto-computational thinking but maybe use another type of definition like critical thinking (critical thinking is probably part of computational thinking) -> Michael does not necessarily value the name 'proto-computational thinking'
% argument: people (from maybe low-SES) are scared off by CS because they think it is 'difficult', 'only for nerds', 'only for the smartest people'

% what kind of different types of representations are there? In music we have all kinds of note schemes, even depending on what instrument you play it may be different

% Question to answer: why would representing the music in different kinds of structures\representations suddenly make students convinced that they can do CS as well?
% - explain the thought process (maybe some psychology behind it)
% - explain the steps that are taken by the student 

% currently the higher-level argument in the grant is kind of missing. 

\todo{Meagan: Need to review how CT is currently employed across the country. Do we want to argue that schools typically employ CT over PCT?}

\todo{Argue that PCT would be better over general CT to improve equity and engagement with music+CS in diverse groups?}

Although the term CT is relatively new, the practice of teaching CT has been around in education for many years, albeit under different terms~\cite{czerkawski2015exploring}, i.e., procedural thinking~\cite{papert1980mindstorms}, operational thinking, .... One of the earliest known examples of introducing CT to education is during an introductory programming course by Alan Perlis in 1962 at Carnegie Mellon University--then Carnegie Institute of Technology~\cite{perlis1962computer}. In various education systems, CT is being introduced in school curricula simply under labels such as `Computing', `Digital Technologies', and `Computer Science'~\cite{duncan2015pilot, heintz2016reviewofmodels, hubwieser2015global}. However, the introduction of CT in school curricula raises several concerns \cite{tatar2017protoCT}. For our purposes the most relevant is the fact that school curricula tend to be full, and introducing another subject poses the risk of impairing the notion of offering students a `rounded education'~\cite{bell2018integrating}.

1. there's success integrating it in other courses/disciplines

2. we note that many other disciplines have more proportionate representation of all demographics than computer science

3. we also want tot take an integrated approach

\section{Purpose}
% what you're doing

The purpose of this project is to introduce computational thinking to instrumental education students (like those in middle school band and orchestra classes). Our approach will be to integrate new activities into MusicCPR. MusicCPR is a niche Learning Management System for band and orchestra classes. MusicCPR is implemented as a web application and continues an iterative design and development process as part of its participatory design process including current in-service and pre-service instrumental music educators and music education researchers as co-designers.

MusicCPR currently has ``Creativity'' activities that task the student with composing a musical score (see figure) \todo{make this figure}. As part of this project, we will design and develop new versions of the existing Creativity activities. In the new versions, we will add a block-based programming interface. Deciding which block language to use, and exactly what the user experience with the blocks should be is part of this project's effort. In the interest of illustrating the design space, we now provide a possible implementation.

\subsection{Possible Implementation}
% 

\textbf{Implementation Questions:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item What language should code blocks be translated to? (Python, Previously existing teaching language, Pseudo Code?)
    \item How many steps should there be in the gradual introduction of- and expectation to use/interact with- programming blocks? e.g. 3-step plan students will be assigned 3 pieces of repertoire in sequence in musiccpr: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item student completes all activities as they are right now in musiccpr for 1 piece of repertoire.
        \item when doing compose for the 2nd piece they will see blocks appear corresponding to the authoring they're doing, perhaps be asked some guided inquiry questions about the blocks
        \item when doing 3rd piece's compose activity, they might be asked to manipulate the blocks
    \end{itemize}
    \item How should the users compose their score? (FlatIO?, etc.)
    \item Does each portion of the project (Code blocks, music score creation, translation) need to be implemented in separate steps, or should work be done on all parts in tandem?
    \item How much Fall time should be spent on research before implementation should begin?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Block Programming for Music Composition}


% Research and develop software to introduce more students to computational thinking.
 % MusicCPR could be a good platform to expose students to programming and computer science-related ideas. 
% \end{itemize}


\subsection{Research Methods}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Early prototype have music people (maybe Matt test?)
    \item second wizard of OZ with music teachers?
    \item actual students?
\end{itemize}
%  tentative schedule/timeline
\subsection{Fall 2024}
Build the programming blocks and Features (ideally this would be a bit iterative and participatory)

\subsection{Spring 2025}
Have people use it (they should have earlier, but this will be more specifically a broader audience than your co-designers or design informants)

The primary objective of this thesis project is to complement the existing work on MusicCPR with new features that introduce computational thinking in a more familiar context than as a standalone course.
In the United States, many more students have access to instrumental music education than to computer science or computational thinking education.
The students who have access to computer science and computational thinking education opportunities tend to belong to demographics that experience disproportionate unearned privilege in comparison to a school's overall demographic profile.
By developing activities in MusicCPR that introduce computational thinking, we have the opportunity to increase access to computational thinking education.
This might support the students in their primary task (composing music for their instrumental music course) in addition to providing opportunities for students who may not have otherwise had access to experience computational thinking education.
This could broaden participation in computing education by groups that are currently underrepresented.
To study the potential for increasing access and opportunity to various students, we must collect student demographic and experience data:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item race
    \item class
    \item gender
    \item past/current experience with computing education
\end{enumerate}

% Have you ver done programming activity in or out of school?
% computer science class in the school (informal vs formal education)
% camp, etc.
% level of interest 

% Steal stuff from grant proposal shared in Luke google drive



With the project's main objective being the introduction of computational thinking to more students with an additional goal of increasing participation in courses by a group of students who more accurately represent the demographics of the school. Relevant demographic information of participating students such as gender, race, and socio-economic background should be collected in order to assess the success of this part of the objective. This data should also be used to compare against the overall demographics of the school. 

A number of quantitative assessments can be administered for additional analysis like pre and post program assessments to measure knowledge of computer concepts, additional tests for music compositional aptitude, as well as classroom analytics like participation, attendance, and retention. Qualitative surveys and questionnaires could be used to gauge both student and teacher feedback in addition to recording potential interest or disinterest in computer science and music composition further into the future of their academic career. 

The comparison to already existing `Creativity' activities within MusicCPR would provide a benchmark for assessing how these new features impact student engagement and learning outcomes. By evaluating both sets of activities under similar conditions, we can determine whether the proposed innovations offer significant improvements in terms of user interaction, creative output, and overall effectiveness within the program. While comparing these new ideas to the existing `Creativity' activities within MusicCPR would provide valuable insights into their relative impact on student engagement and learning outcomes, such an analysis may extend beyond the scope of this project due to time constraints. However, this could be an area for future research, allowing for a more comprehensive evaluation of the program's overall effectiveness.
