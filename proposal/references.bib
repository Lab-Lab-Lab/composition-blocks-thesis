abstract = {This paper describes the design of an online learning platform that empowers musical creation and performance with Python code. For this platform we have developed an innovative computational notebook paradigm that we call TunePad playbooks. While playbooks borrow ideas from popular computational notebooks like Jupyter, we have designed them from the ground up to support creative musical expression including live performances. After discussing our design principles and features, we share findings from a series of artifact-centered interviews conducted with experienced TunePad users. Our results show how systems like ours might flexibly support a variety of creative workflows, while suggesting opportunities for future work in this area.},

abstract = {The integration of computer programming and music-making has a rich history dating back to the 1950s. While there has been substantial prior work on the creative and cognitive affordances of programming languages for engaging in musical tasks, there is less work that attempts to understand the theoretical implications of music and code as literacies in collision. In this paper, we report on a study in which five undergraduate students with experience in both music and coding completed two creative musical tasks: one using conventional instruments and tools and one using Python code in an online music-coding environment. In combining representational infrastructures from music and code, both undergo transformations. We introduce semiotic theories of translation and transcription to make sense of the music-coding process and describe strategies that participants devised in their creative process.},

abstract = {To accelerate the adoption of computational thinking (CT), we have developed TuneScope, an online platform for introducing novices to programming in the context of music. TuneScope combines a sound analysis \& synthesis tool with Snap!, a computing language developed at the University of California, Berkeley. This demo explores CT concepts such as decomposition, patterns, abstraction, and algorithms in TuneScope while also exploring the creation of four cascading musical components from (1) sequences of notes, (2) musical chords, (3) sampled sounds, and (4) synthesized sounds. The challenge is to design activities that include authentic music learning as well as genuine computational thinking. In this demo, we show concepts around sequence (the order in which musical notes appear in time; and the order of statements in a computer program) and repetition (includes repeats as well as the structure of melodies; and computing loops and recursion). The instructional activities in this demo have been piloted three times in an associated course at the University of Virginia. Data collected from the course suggest a positive effect on both the understanding of CT concepts and the comprehension of music. More detail on TuneScope can be found at https://maketolearn.org/tunescope/.},
